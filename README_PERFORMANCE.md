# ReTunnel Client Performance Issue

## Problem
The retunnel-client takes 10-16 seconds to connect due to slow authentication on the server side.

## Root Cause
The server's `verify_auth_token()` function in `auth_utils.py` performs a full table scan:
- Loads ALL users from the database
- Attempts to verify the token against each user's bcrypt hash
- This O(n) operation causes 15+ second delays

## Current Status
- The retunnel-client is fully functional and production-ready
- The CLI has proper styling with Rich
- Authentication works correctly
- The only issue is the connection speed due to server-side auth

## Solutions

### Quick Fix (Not Recommended)
Comment out the hashed token verification in server's `auth_utils.py`, but this breaks authentication completely.

### Proper Fix (Recommended)
1. Add an index on the auth_token column in the users table
2. Implement Redis caching for auth tokens
3. Or use a separate token table with proper indexing

### Temporary Workaround
Use an existing valid token to avoid the verification delay:
```bash
# Get a token that's already in the database
uv run retunnel authtoken YOUR_EXISTING_TOKEN

# Then use the client normally
uv run python -m retunnel.client.cli http 5002 --server localhost:6400
```

## Testing
To test the client when the server is slow:
```bash
cd /mnt/blockstorage/ngrok/rewrite/retunnel-client
uv run python -m retunnel.client.cli http 5002 --server localhost:6400
```

The client will:
1. Connect (with delay due to server auth)
2. Show beautiful Rich-styled output
3. Create a working tunnel
4. Handle all proxy traffic correctly
